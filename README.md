# RentalScraper
Gathers data of rental properties off of TradeMe.co.nz, and puts them into a nicely formatted CSV file.

You can open the data, and use it for analysis for later.
It's also a convenient way to quickly filter for all of the properties you might want to move into!
No more mindless scrolling! I used this myself as well.

TO-DO:

Write instructions for others

(if have met me before though: Feel free to ask me to give you a demo, in-case I don't get around to this!)
