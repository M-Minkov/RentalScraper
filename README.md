# RentalScraper
Gathers data of rental properties off of TradeMe.co.nz, and puts them into a nicely formatted CSV file.

You can open the data, and use it for analysis for later.
It's also a convenient way to quickly filter for all of the properties you might want to move into!
No more mindless scrolling! I used this myself as well.

TO-DO:
Write instructions on how to use
